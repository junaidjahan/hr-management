# hr-management

This project is built with Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, Directus SDK, Vue Query.

## Approach
I used the Facade and KISS pattern and the latest vue composable approach to maximize the reusability and code maintenance. 

## Improvements
If I could get more time then I would set the theme and colors on application level and also design the components more generically and with details.

npm install
```
